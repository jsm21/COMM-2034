     <h1>Overview</h1>
     <h2>Comm 2034</h2>
     <p>Comm 2034, otherwise known as "Visual Media", is perhaps my most hands-on class. The purpose of the course,
       in the words of the syllabus, is to "introduce [students] to the concepts and skills needed to succeed as producers of
       media, journalism, public relations, and other communication artifacts." Visual Media is a class that entails writing,
        photography, video editing, and design. We work with online programs such as Adobe InDesign, Premiere Pro, and Photoshop.
        To succeed in this class, students must be creative, diligent, work well in groups, and follow the teacher's instructions.
        Anyone who can put forth their best effort will succeed with Dr. Evia at the helm.</p>

    <h1>My Teacher: Dr. Carlos Evia</h1
      <p>I had the privilege of working under the tutelage of Dr. Carlos Evia in the fall of 2018 for my Visual Media class.
        Dr. Evia was educated at the Instituto de Ciencias Sociales de Merida, where he earned a bachelor's degree in
        Communication Science. He went on to receive a master in Computer Systems at Universidad La Salle in Mexico City, and
        finally earned a Ph.D. in Technical Communication and Rhetoric at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. He is truly a
        "jack of all trades". Dr. Evia came to Virginia Tech in 2004, where he is currently an associate professor of Professional
        Communication, as well as an associate professor of Health Sciences.</p>

        <p>Dr. Evia has written a book entitled "Creating Intelligent Content with Lightweight DITA", which is due to be published
          in December of 2018. He was recognized with "Outstanding Faculty Outreach" for the Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences
          in May of 2011. In 2017, Dr. Evia was honored with the Frank R. Smith Award for Distinguished Article in the Journal Technical
          Communication. Throughout his academic career, he has written numerous journal articles and delivered a multitude of conference
        presentations, all while educating undergraduate and postgraduate students at Virginia Tech.</p>
    <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
      <p>Visual Media is a fantastic class for students who want to express themselves creatively through photography, videography,
      and design. In this course, I was able to collaborate with fellow classmates to create a magazine spread in Adobe InDesign. I was
      able to take scenic photos of Blacksburg, Virginia and edit them in Photoshop. I worked with a group to create a documentary-style
      video on transportation around the Virginia Tech campus, which was as funny as it was challenging. And above all, I created this
      website using my recently-acquired knowledge of HTML, Atom, and Github. Our class was a very tight-knit group that enjoyed each
      other's company and used our time productively, and I would like to think that the skills and programs we learned COMM 2034 will
      be useful to us in the future.</p>
