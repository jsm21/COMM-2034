     <h1>Overview</h1>
     <h2>Intro to Sports Media</h2>
     <p>If you have a love for sports like I do, Intro to Sports Media is one of the most enjoyable classes you can take
       here at Virginia Tech. I was lucky enough to take the class as part of my Communication major with a focus in Sports
       Media & Analytics. The course, which is hosted in McBryde Hall on Monday and Wednesday afternoons, focuses on
       "opportunities for journalists, production staff, and public relations professionals." It places an emphasis on the
       evolution of sports journalism, ethics in sports media, and social media. We only met in class periodically, however,
       and in lieu of class time we completed online Canvas quizzes supplemented by Virtual Lectures. The quizzes, along with
       a major group project, constituted the bulk of our grade.</p>

      <h1>My Teacher: Bill Roth</h1>
      <p>If you know anything about Virginia Tech athletics, you have to know Bill Roth. Bill was the voice of Hokie sports from
        1988 to 2015, calling hundreds if not thousands of Hokie football and basketball games on the radio. Born and raised in a
        suburb outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Bill graduated from Syracuse University in 1987 and began his broadcasting career
        at Tech shortly thereafter. He is a member of the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015, Roth left Blacksburg to become the
        play-by-play voice of the UCLA Bruins, though he returned to his East Coast roots a year later, and now teaches within the Department
        of Communication.</p>

      <p>As a teacher, Bill is extremely consice and articulate. He tends to go fast-paced and prefers to get his students
        involved as much as he can, rather than simply read off the presentation slides. You can tell by his persona that he is
        well-informed on the issues of which he speaks.</p>

      <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
      <p>As an aspiring sports broadcaster, I think it is awesome to be in the presence of a sports legend like Bill Roth. While the
        quizzes can sometimes be challenging, if you take good notes you will be successful. Bill is never a stranger to throwing his
        students a curveball, so it's important to remember small details in class that may appear on quizzes. The biggest project we
        did this semester was the Analytics Project. This was a group project focused on marketing a sports event or team, and using
        as much data, numbers, and analytics as we could to support said event or team. My group decided to create an MLB expansion
        franchise in Charlotte, North Carolina. I never realized how many little things you have to consider when proposing such a thing:
        the regional demographics, stadium location, advertisers, and more. It just goes to show that there is always more than meets
        the eye when it comes to sports marketing. For anyone with a passion for sports marketing, broadcasting, or journalism, Bill Roth's
        class is a must-take.</p>
