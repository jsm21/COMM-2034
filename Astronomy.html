     <h1>Overview</h1>
     <h2>Introduction to Astronomy</h2>
     <p>Introduction to Astronomy, otherwise known as PHYS 1055, is a class all about what the name might suggest: astronomy. It falls under
       CLE Category 4, entitled "Scientific Reasoning and Discovery". The class attempts to educate students about our universe by
       "understanding how we’ve come to know what we know through a science- and evidence-based worldview." We discuss physics, the
       formation of Earth and univerise, telescopes, light, asteroids, the scientific method, and more. I attend this class twice a week
       (Tuesday and Thursday) in Squires Colonial Hall from 3:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.<p>

    <h1>My Teacher: Brandon Bear</h1>
    <p>My astronomy professor, Brandon Bear, is an all-around cool dude. He is a native of Hellam, Pennsylvania and ran cross country
      and track and field for Eastern York High School, where he set numerous school records. He continued to run track for Elizabethtown
      College (PA). Not suprisingly, Brandon pursued coaching after graduation, and is currently in his fourth season as the head cross
      country coach at Blacksburg High School. Academically, Brandon has earned two master’s degrees from Virginia Tech, including one
      in Educational Psychology. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in physics. At his home in Blacksburg, Brandon has a cat named Kitty,
      a puppy named Ginger (see below), and a leopard gecko named Cruiser, which you might find out sooner or later attending his lectures.</p>

      <p>More than anything, Brandon is a nice and approachable professor who is always willing to lend a hand to students who need it.
        I am grateful to have him as one of my teachers.<p>
    <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
    <p>Introduction to Astronomy is a class where what a student gets out of the course will be equal to what they put into it. Most of one's
      grade lies in the periodic class quizzes, homework assignments on Mastering Astronomy, two in-semester exams, and the final exam. The quizzes
      are fairly easy, and while the Mastering Astronomy assignments can be challenging, they are due just once a week so students have ample
      time to complete them. If you simply take good notes in class and study those notes for the exams, you will do well. In my experience,
      while the lectures can be tough to  endure, it helps that Brandon tries to make funny jokes when he can. Not only that, but you can earn
      TopHat points merely for showing up to class. Overall, Introduction to Astronomy is a worthwhile class for anyone looking to fulfill their
      CLE requirements, or bolster their understanding of astronomy.
