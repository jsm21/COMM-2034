     <h1>Overview</h1>
     <h2>Language & Logic</h2>
     <p>Language & Logic is a CLE Area 5 class that deals with evaluating reasoning and applying that reasoning to our own writing and
       thinking. In this class, labelled as PHIL 1504, we discuss different types of arguments, biases, logical fallacies, and
       sentential logic. This class meets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings in Torgersen Hall.

    <h1>My Teacher: Dr. Ted Parent</h1>
    <p>Dr. Ted Parent, or as he prefers to be called, Ted, has an expertise in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, epistemology
      and metaphysics. He received a Master of Arts (M.A.) from Indiana University in Bloomington in 2000, and later earned an M.A. at
      the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2002. Seven years later, in 2009, Ted received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from
      North Carolina. That same year, Ted came to Virginia Tech and started as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Philosophy Department. He frequently
      writes articles on topics relating to this field and published a book entitled "Self-Reflection for the Opaque Mind" in 2017.</p>

    <p>Ted is a very even-keeled professor who is steady and consice in his explanation of the class material. If a student asks a question, he will
      always pauses briefly to reflect and think of the right answer. He also prevents the usage of cell phones and computers in class, which is very
      beneficial as it eliminates unnecessary distractions. Overall, he makes the coursework easy to digest.</p>

    <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
    <p>For the most part, Language & Logic is an easy class for me. Coming into the semester, I already had a modest understanding of some of
      the material presented in the course, such as different types of fallacies and biases. Because of that, it was easy for me to expand upon
      that base of knowledge. I always made an effort to review each night before a quiz so that I would be as prepared as possible. As a result,
      I have done tremendously well on the graded material, including both quizzes and homework assignments. While sitting through a fifty-minute
      lecture on logic may not be the most riveted experience in the world, a good grade is well worth the effort that goes into paying attention
      in class and studying outside of class.
