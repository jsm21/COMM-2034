     <h1>Overview</h1>
     <h2>History of the Modern World</h2>
    <p>History of the Modern World falls under CLE Area 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context. The course focuses on a wide range
      of global events, from the Trans-Atlantic slave trade to World War II. The course looks at how these historical events have
      impacted the world we live in today. In the class, we study topics and themes such as colonialism, capitalism, slavery,
      nationalism, and much more. The goal of the class is to get students to "think like a historian and to critically assess the
      past."</p>
     <h1>My Teacher: Taulby Edmondson</h1>
     <p>My professor, Taulby Edmondson, earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in History and Sociology from Emory & Henry College in 2010. He then
       obtained a Master of Arts (M.A.) in History at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. He considers himself a scholar
       of race and nationalism, and much of his research focuses on the memory politics of slavery and the Civil War in the modern United
       States, especially the "Lost Cause" movement. An aspiring social scientist, Professor Edmondson is currently working on his Ph.D. here
       at Virginia Tech. He has been a member of the VT community since 2012.</p>

      <p>Professor Edmondson is extremely well-versed in all things relating to U.S. and even world history, and it shows in his lectures.
        His presentations move along fairly quickly, and he does not include much of what he says on his powerpoints. Therefore, it is up to the
        student to focus in class so they can retain the information presented. Thankfully, I already had familiarity with Professor Edmondson as
        I took his Civil War class in the Spring of 2018. He is an excellent teacher and will make an effort to answer students' questions in as much
        detail as he possibly can.

     <h1>My Thoughts</h2>
       History of the Modern World is a classs that is very heavy on details. As I noted before, it is very important to pay attention to the lecture
       in class because most of the important details mentioned will not appear on a screen. The bulk of the course grade comes in the form of two items.
       First, there are eight Canvas quizzes throughout the semester. To do well on these quizzes, you must read the supplementary handouts on Canvas and
       the required texts. There is no "easy way out". Second, we completed a five-page Critical Book Report (CBR) in early November, which accounts for
       35% of our grade. While this book report was very challenging for me, I spent a significant amount of time and energy into my essay and I felt it
       turned out very well. I have always been a fan of history class going back to elementary school, so it is not surprising to me that I was so motivated
       to do well.</p>
